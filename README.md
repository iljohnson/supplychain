save the excel file to your windows desktop and run the code in python. 

Select which sheet of the test code you load by changing the sheet name in the code.

Upon running the Silver-Meal code you will be asked to enter the level of inventory you wish to use as current holding inventory level, the default is 0. 

The non seasonaility version of the Wagner-Whiten will ask you to set a holding cost and set-up cost and use this information for every period, the default values are 1 and 1. The seasonality version will load this information, for each period, from the data test sheet. 

The excel or dataframe input format allows you to set a seperate holding cost and manufacturing cost for each period (seasonaility). 

The results will be saved to your windows desktop.
